# Health Patients Visit Analysis

### 📌 Project Overview

The Health Patients Visit Dashboard is a data analytics project built using Power BI to analyze patient visitation patterns, treatment costs, length of hospital stay, and diagnosis trends across departments, demographics, time periods, and locations.

The dashboard is designed to support healthcare administrators and decision-makers in understanding cost drivers, identifying operational inefficiencies, and improving patient care delivery through data-driven insights.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze total treatment cost and length of hospital stay

- Identify monthly diagnosis trends

- Compare treatment costs across hospital departments

- Examine patient distribution by age group and gender

- Evaluate average length of stay by diagnosis and outcome

- Analyze treatment cost patterns by day of the week

- Visualize geographic distribution of treatment costs

### 📊 Key Metrics (KPIs)

- Total Treatment Cost: ₦38.39M

- Total Length of Stay: 1,764 days

- Diagnosis Count by Month

- Average Treatment Cost

- Average Length of Stay

- Cost Distribution by Department, City, and Day

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Power BI Desktop [ Download here ](https://microsoft.com)

- Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)

### 📈 Dashboard Features & Analysis

1️⃣ Diagnosis Trend Analysis

- Diagnoses peak in January, with another rise between April–May and August–September.

- A steady decline is observed towards November and December.

- Insight:
This indicates seasonal healthcare demand, which is crucial for planning staffing and medical resources.

2️⃣ Treatment Cost by Department

- Pediatrics and Maternity departments incur the highest treatment costs.

- Emergency and Inpatient services also contribute significantly.

- Insurance and HMO payments dominate across departments.

- Insight:
Critical-care departments are major cost drivers and require close financial monitoring.

3️⃣ Patient Demographics (Age Group & Gender)

- Adult patients account for the majority of diagnoses.

- Female patients slightly outnumber male patients across most age groups.

- Youth and children have comparatively fewer diagnoses.

- Insight:
Hospital services should be optimized primarily for adult care while maintaining pediatric capacity.

4️⃣ Length of Stay by Diagnosis & Outcome

- Patients under treatment have the longest average hospital stay.

- Chronic conditions such as Hypertension, Diabetes, and Ulcer show extended stay durations.

- Insight:
Chronic illnesses significantly increase bed occupancy and treatment costs.

5️⃣ Treatment Cost by Day of the Week

- Costs peak on Fridays and Saturdays.

- Wednesdays also show relatively high average treatment costs.

- Insight:
Higher weekend costs may be driven by emergency cases, overtime staffing, or limited outpatient operations.

6️⃣ Geographic Cost Distribution

- Ibadan records the highest treatment cost concentration.

- Surrounding cities such as Ogbomosho and Ilorin also contribute significantly.

- Insight:
The hospital serves as a regional healthcare hub, increasing pressure on facilities and staff.

### ✅ Key Recommendations

- Implement early discharge and follow-up programs to reduce prolonged hospital stays.

- Improve preventive healthcare initiatives for chronic conditions.

- Strengthen weekend staffing and operations to manage peak costs.

- Optimize departmental budgeting, especially for Pediatrics, Maternity, and Emergency units.

- Partner with regional clinics to decentralize patient load.

- Review and renegotiate Insurance/HMO agreements to ensure cost efficiency.

### 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of Power BI for healthcare analytics, showcasing skills in data modeling, visualization, DAX calculations, and business insight generation. The dashboard enables stakeholders to make informed decisions that improve patient outcomes while controlling operational costs.
